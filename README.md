### Hi there üëã, I am Tatia
#### Welcome to my GitHub

Well rounded experience transitioning from a successful humanities profession in nursing to software engineering. Working in healthcare for half of a decade taught me the importance of paying attention to detail and helped to develop an agile mentality of solutioning in a scalable and repeatable manner. After deciding to pursue my software engineering career full-time, I have taken my ‚Äúlessons-learned‚Äù from my previous experience and applied my critical thinking prowess into positively impacting what I saw firsthand as an area needing improvement in an important industry. As I‚Äôve continued expanding my expertise while leveraging my previous experience, I have found my current passion aligning with software engineering holistically and am dedicating myself to growing in that expertise specifically.
